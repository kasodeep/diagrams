DFD:
	A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation that depicts how data flows through a system.
	It's widely used in software engineering and systems analysis to illustrate the pathways data takes from its source to its destination, including processes, storage, and external entities.

Components of a Data Flow Diagram:
	Processes:
		Represent functions or transformations that process data.
		They are typically depicted as circles or rectangles with labels describing the function they perform.

	Data Flows:
		Arrows that represent the movement of data between processes, data stores, and external entities.
		They show the direction of data flow and what data is being exchanged.

	Data Stores:
		Represent where data is held within the system.
		These can be databases, files, or any storage medium.
		They are often depicted as open-ended rectangles.

	External Entities:
		Represent sources or destinations of data outside the system being modeled.
		These could be users, other systems, or devices that interact with the system.
		They are often depicted as squares.

Types of DFDs:
	Logical DFDs:
		Focus on the flow of data and processes, without considering physical implementation details.

	Physical DFDs:
		Illustrate the actual hardware and software components involved in data processing and storage.

Benefits:
	Improved Understanding:
		DFDs help identify data flows, bottlenecks, and potential issues in a system.

	Enhanced Security:
		By visualizing data paths, DFDs can reveal vulnerabilities and aid in securing data.

	Process Optimization:
		DFDs facilitate analysis and improvement of business processes.
