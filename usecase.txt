Usecase:
	A use case diagram is a visual representation in UML (Unified Modeling Language) that describes the interactions between a system and its external entities (actors).
	It outlines the system's functional requirements by showing how actors interact with use cases (specific tasks or functions) to achieve a goal.

Key Components of a Use Case Diagram:
	Actors:
		Represent external entities that interact with the system.
		Can be a person, another system, or an organization.
		They are depicted as stick figures.
		Primary actors initiate interactions, while secondary actors support the use case.

	Use Cases:
		Represent the actions or services the system performs in response to actors.
		They are depicted as ovals, with the name of the action inside the oval.
		Each use case should describe an observable result from the actor's perspective.

	System Boundary:
		Defines the scope of the system and whatâ€™s included or excluded.
		Everything within the boundary represents what the system will handle.
		The boundary is represented by a rectangle that encloses the use cases.

	Relationships:
		Association: Connects actors to use cases, showing which actor is involved in which use case.
		Include: A use case that is always performed as part of another use case.
		Extend: A use case that is optionally triggered by another use case.
		Generalization: Shows inheritance between actors or use cases.
