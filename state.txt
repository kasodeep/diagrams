State Diagram;
	A State Diagram, also known as a State Machine Diagram or UML State Machine Diagram, is a graphical representation of a systemâ€™s behavior, focusing on the different states an object or entity can be in, and how it transitions between those states in response to events.

Components:

State:
	A state represents a condition or situation during the life of an object.
	Notation: 
		Rounded rectangle with the name of the state written inside.
	Example: Idle, Processing, Completed.

	Initial State:
		Represents the starting point of the diagram.
		Every state diagram must have one initial state.
		Notation: 
			A filled black circle.

	Final State:
		Represents the end of the state machine.
		Notation: 
			A black circle with a surrounding hollow circle.

Transition:
	A transition is a movement from one state to another triggered by an event or condition.
	Notation: 
		Arrow between states labeled with the event causing the transition.
	Syntax: 
		Event [Guard Condition] / Action

Events:
	Represent occurrences that trigger state transitions.
	Example: Button press, timeout, receiving a message.

Actions:
	Represent activities performed during a transition or while in a state.

Composite States:
	States can contain nested sub-states.
	Useful for modeling complex systems.

Self-Transition:
	A transition that leads back to the same state.
