Sequence Diagram:
	A Sequence Diagram is a UML diagram that visualizes the flow of messages, events, or interactions between objects in a system over time.
	It is commonly used to model dynamic behavior, focusing on how objects interact to achieve a specific use case or functionality.

Components:

Lifeline:
	Represents an object, actor, or component in the system.
	Shown as a vertical dashed line.

Messages:
	Represent communication between lifelines.
	Types of messages:
		Synchronous Message:
			Requires a response (solid arrow with filled head).
		Asynchronous Message:
			Doesn't require a response (solid arrow with open head).
		Return Message:
			Denotes the return of control (dashed arrow).

Activation Bar:
	Represents the time a lifeline is active and processing a message.
	Shown as a thin vertical rectangle on a lifeline.

Actors:
	Represent external entities interacting with the system.
	Typically shown as stick figures.

Loops and Conditions:
	Represent repeating or conditional behavior.
	Loops are shown with a box labeled loop.
	Conditions are shown with text like [condition].
